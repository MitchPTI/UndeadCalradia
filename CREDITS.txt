Skeleton models (including skeletal horses) by barf: http://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade/mods/1912/?
Note: The above link doesn't include the horse model; I couldn't find an original link to it, only found it in another mod (Rise of the Undead: http://www.moddb.com/mods/rise-of-the-undead) credited to barf

The Crowned Helm worn by Pestilence is an asset from 1257 AD: http://www.moddb.com/mods/anno-domini-1257

Some scripting was borrowed from Silverstag: http://www.moddb.com/mods/silverstag

The undead troop type and assets are originally from Native, but I couldn't get them properly working without a BRF from Prophey of Pendor (http://www.moddb.com/mods/saxondragon), which re-enables them.
